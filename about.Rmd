### Projects / Research

* Udacity user engagement with A/B testing

  *	Recommended strategies for enhancing user engagement and customer satisfaction by designing and executing a comprehensive experiment (A/B Testing) aimed at optimizing the student experience at Udacity.
  
  *	Designed metrics including Retention and Gross conversion rate for the experiment, offered strategic advice on adopting a new trial framework, and suggested enhancements to sample size and the duration of the experiment to achieve precise outcomes. 
  
  *	Conducted hypothesis testing to give insights into Udacityâ€™s strategic decisions.

* Detected disease from Clinical text and images (Research Experience)                          
  * Sourced extensive medical images and clinical data from DFUC, TCGA, and HyperKvasir for comprehensive analysis. Cleaned the text datasets and preprocessed images using normalization, resizing and data augmentation.
  
  * Generated multimodal deep learning operations by integrating robust algorithms: fine-tuning support vector machine (SVM), convolutional neural networks (MobileNet, Inception) for image data, and optimizing NLP models for text analysis.
  
  * Implemented the fusion of models via innovative attention-based and operation-based methods to enrich feature sets and enhance model performance, achieving an accuracy range of 90% to 92%. Developed a GUI to present prediction results.
